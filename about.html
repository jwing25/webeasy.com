<h1>About Computer Science</h1>
<div class="inner">
<p> CS is the study of computational systems, primarily dealing with the design and development of software. A common misconception is that computer science involves solely programming;
    in reality, it involves algorithmic thinking in order to solve problems, whether those problems are as simple as creating a website, to maintaining a secure database. Programming is
    one of many tools computer scientists have in their arsenal.
