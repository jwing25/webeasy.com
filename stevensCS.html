<h1 id="stevens">CS at Stevens</h1>
<div class="inner">
<p> Studying computer science at Stevens is one of the best decisions an aspiring computer scientist could make.
    At Stevens, the department's professors and TAs work closely with students to ensure they not only understand
    the material, but know how to use it to adapt to the ever-evolving industry. Starting from their first semester,
    students will practically apply their knowledge to create websites, programs, and occasionally games or logic puzzles.
    Stevens provides challenging coursework, with the help and reputation to back it up.
